# BBCode-HTML-Text-Colorizer 
### *For when you can't bother to color characters individually!*


## Motivation

In HTML (and its easier-to-use forum counterpart, BBCode) text is often colored for emphasis, clarity, and/or aesthetic. Below is an example of coloring a line in both BBCode and HTML, repectively, and how they look when compiled.


```#BBCode
[color=#ff0000]THIS IS THE COLOR RED[/color]
```

```#HTML
<span style="color:#ff0000">THIS IS THE COLOR RED</span>
```
